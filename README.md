# bicycle_ridership_prediction
Data analysis and bicycle ridership prediction in NYC.

The data consists of details of bridge bicycle volumes at four bridges in USA (April-October 2017).

Included in the data are variables such as the week days, holidays, and weather conditions.

This project aims to segment the ridership data and build a regression model which will predict bicycle ridership data.

The main findings in the data have been presented in graphic format and the data analysis has been carried out in Python.

The models used in the analysis are linear regression and a multiple linear regression.
